## 📋 Usage Examples

### Creating a Campaign

```clarity
(contract-call? .crowdfund create-campaign-advanced
    "Revolutionary AI Platform"
    "Building the future of AI with ethical guidelines"
    u1000000000 ;; 1000 STX goal
    u14400      ;; 100 days
    "technology"
    "AI,blockchain,ethics")
```

### Contributing to Campaigns

```clarity
;; Single contribution
(contract-call? .crowdfund contribute-advanced
    u1          ;; campaign-id
    u100000000) ;; 100 STX

;; Batch contributions
(contract-call? .crowdfund batch-contribute
    (list 
        {campaign-id: u1, amount: u50000000}
        {campaign-id: u2, amount: u30000000}))
```

### Governance Participation

```clarity
;; Create proposal
(contract-call? .crowdfund create-governance-proposal
    "Reduce Platform Fee"
    "Proposal to reduce platform fee from 2.5% to 2.0%"
    "fee-change"
    u200      ;; 2.0% in basis points
    u1440)    ;; 10-day voting period

;; Vote on proposal
(contract-call? .crowdfund vote-on-proposal
    u1        ;; proposal-id
