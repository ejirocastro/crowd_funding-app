- `duration` (uint): Campaign duration in blocks
- `category` (string-ascii 50): Campaign category (must be pre-registered)

**Validation:**
- Title: 1-100 characters, valid ASCII
- Description: 10-500 characters minimum meaningful content

## Usage Examples

### Complete Campaign Lifecycle

```clarity
;; 1. Initialize platform (owner only)
(contract-call? .crowdfund initialize-categories)

;; 2. Create campaign
(contract-call? .crowdfund create-campaign-advanced
    "Eco-Friendly Water Purifier"
    "Developing affordable water purification technology for developing regions"
    u500000000  ;; 500 STX goal
    u7200       ;; 50 days
    "environment"
    "water,sustainability,health")

;; 3. Contribute to campaign
(contract-call? .crowdfund contribute-advanced
    u1          ;; campaign-id
    u50000000)  ;; 50 STX contribution

;; 4. Check campaign progress
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-campaign u1)
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-campaign-analytics u1)

;; 5. Batch contributions
(contract-call? .crowdfund batch-contribute
    (list 
        {campaign-id: u1, amount: u25000000}
        {campaign-id: u1, amount: u25000000}))

;; 6. Withdraw funds (creator only, after campaign ends and goal reached)
(contract-call? .crowdfund withdraw-funds u1)
```

### Governance Participation

```clarity
;; 1. Create proposal to change platform fee

    "Reduce Platform Fee to 2%"
    "Community proposal to reduce platform fee from 2.5% to 2% to encourage more campaigns"
    "fee-change"
    u200        ;; 2% in basis points
    u1440)      ;; 10 day voting period

;; 2. Vote on proposal
(contract-call? .crowdfund vote-on-proposal
    u1          ;; proposal-id
    true)       ;; vote yes

;; 3. Execute proposal (after voting period ends)
(contract-call? .crowdfund execute-proposal u1)
```

### Analytics and Monitoring

```clarity
;; Platform overview
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-platform-stats)

;; Category performance
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-category-info "technology")
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-category-info "environment")

;; User activity
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-user-campaigns 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE)
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-user-contributions 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE)

;; Campaign details
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-campaign u1)
(contract-call? .crowdfund get-campaign-analytics u1)
```

## Rate Limiting

The platform implements sophisticated rate limiting to prevent spam and ensure fair usage:

- **Campaign Creation**: Maximum 5 campaigns per block per user
- **Contributions**: Maximum 50 contributions per block per user
- **Governance Proposals**: Minimum voting power required

Rate limits reset each block and are tracked per user address.

## Security Features

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are comprehensively validated
2. **Access Control**: Multi-level permission system
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and DoS attacks
4. **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker functionality
5. **KYC Integration**: Optional identity verification
6. **Audit Trail**: All actions are recorded on-chain
